# rating

Frontend mentor challenge
Built using html, css and javascript

The user selects a rating, and upon pressing the submit button,
the card gives you the score you selected and displays a thank you message

I used both flexbox and grid for this one
Biggest challenge was the javascript part, because it had been a long time since
I had written any javascript code. 

The code is still messy, but everything works as it should
